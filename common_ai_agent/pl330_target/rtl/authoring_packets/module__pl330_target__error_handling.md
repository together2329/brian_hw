# RTL Authoring Packet: module__pl330_target__error_handling

- Kind: module
- Owner module: pl330_target
- Owner file: rtl/pl330_target.sv
- Task count: 1
- Required tasks: 1

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: production
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: True
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: False
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 0
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- Module slice: 5/10 section=error_handling task_limit=48
- Slice rule: Owner module pl330_target is split into 10 authoring slices. Update the same owner_file incrementally and preserve logic from earlier slices.
- Reference scale profile: reports/rtl_reference_profile.json (calibration-only, files=143, modules=210, lines=130568)
- Reference target-candidate subset: basis=design_candidate, files=57, modules=52, lines=52338
- Reference target-scale candidate present; SSOT target_scale is not locked yet
- Connection contract gap: Production-profile multi-module RTL requires machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections before top integration or signoff can close.
- Pending connection-contract suggestions: 398 rows in rtl/connection_contract_suggestions.json
- Draft top integration fragment: rtl/connection_contract_draft_top.svfrag
- Suggestion usage: draft RTL wiring may use these rows to close hierarchy/signal-flow evidence, but they are not SSOT authority and cannot close connection-contract signoff.

## Tasks

### RTL-0246: Implement error/fault item recovery_0

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: error_handling.recovery
- Source ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0
- Detail: This SSOT error_handling.recovery item must map to RTL behavior, integration evidence, or a precise blocker.
SSOT ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0.
Owner: pl330_target in rtl/pl330_target.sv via top_fallback.
- Current reason: Task criteria are closed by SSOT traceability plus owner RTL/audit evidence.
- Criteria:
  - RTL owner/evidence is named for this SSOT item
  - Behavior is not represented only by comments or TB code
  - Downstream verification can observe or justify the item
  - Traceability keeps source_ref error_handling.recovery.recovery_0
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pl330_target.sv
- SSOT refs: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0
