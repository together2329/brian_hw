# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_contract_blocked

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: pl330_target
- Owner file: rtl/pl330_target.sv
- Task count: 1
- Required tasks: 1

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: production
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: False
- Evidence closure allowed: True
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: False
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 0
- Human-locked open tasks: 2
- Reference scale profile: reports/rtl_reference_profile.json (calibration-only, files=143, modules=210, lines=130568)
- Reference target-candidate subset: basis=design_candidate, files=57, modules=52, lines=52338
- Reference target-scale candidate present; SSOT target_scale is not locked yet
- Connection contract gap: Production-profile multi-module RTL requires machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections before top integration or signoff can close.
- Pending connection-contract suggestions: 398 rows in rtl/connection_contract_suggestions.json
- Draft top integration fragment: rtl/connection_contract_draft_top.svfrag
- Suggestion usage: draft RTL wiring may use these rows to close hierarchy/signal-flow evidence, but they are not SSOT authority and cannot close connection-contract signoff.
  - pl330_target_engine.busy <= engine_busy (observed_named_port_map)
  - pl330_target_engine.channel_state <= engine_channel_state (observed_named_port_map)

  - pl330_target_engine.cmd_opcode <= engine_cmd_opcode (observed_named_port_map)
  - pl330_target_engine.cmd_privileged <= engine_cmd_privileged (observed_named_port_map)
- Locked-truth blockers:
  - manifest_connection_contract_evidence: Production-profile multi-module RTL requires machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections before top integration or signoff can close.
  - manifest_connection_contract_evidence: 1 SSOT connection contract issue(s) remain. connection: Production-profile multi-module RTL has no machine-readable SSOT connection contracts
- SSOT top IO contracts: 11

## Tasks

### RTL-0016: Gate: SSOT connection contracts match RTL child port maps

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
- Detail: Named port maps prove that child instances are wired, but not that they are wired to the SSOT-intended signals. When the SSOT provides integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections, rtl-gen must satisfy those machine-readable connection contracts. Production-profile multi-module RTL must provide such contracts.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence.
Owner: pl330_target in rtl/pl330_target.sv via top_fallback.
- Current reason: 1 SSOT connection contract issue(s) remain. connection: Production-profile multi-module RTL has no machine-readable SSOT connection contracts
- Criteria:
  - Production-profile multi-module IPs provide machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections
  - Each SSOT connection contract resolves to a reachable manifest child module and port
  - RTL named port-map expressions match the SSOT-intended signal terms or carry an explicit SSOT waiver
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pl330_target.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
