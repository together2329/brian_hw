# RTL Authoring Packet: module__dma_scratch_orch_live_20260519b__synthesis

- Kind: module
- Owner module: dma_scratch_orch_live_20260519b
- Owner file: rtl/dma_scratch_orch_live_20260519b.sv
- Task count: 6
- Required tasks: 6

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: standard
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: True
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: True
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 6
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- Owner refs: dataflow, decomposition, integration, io_list, top_module
- Module slice: 11/15 section=synthesis task_limit=48
- Slice rule: Owner module dma_scratch_orch_live_20260519b is split into 15 authoring slices. Update the same owner_file incrementally and preserve logic from earlier slices.
- SSOT top IO contracts: 23
