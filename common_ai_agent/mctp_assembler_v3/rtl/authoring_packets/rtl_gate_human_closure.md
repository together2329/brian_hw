# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_human_closure

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: mctp_assembler_v3
- Owner file: rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- Task count: 7
- Required tasks: 7

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Tasks tagged repair_generated_fm_marker are advisory schema-repair markers; they are omitted from authoring packets and must not cause fm*_observed RTL ports, wires, or state.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Tasks

### RTL-0003: Gate: SSOT function_model and cycle_model are present before RTL generation

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
- Detail: rtl-gen cannot implement production RTL until the SSOT contains both the functional golden behavior and the cycle/handshake contract.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: SSOT function_model and cycle_model authority is present.
- Criteria:
  - function_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - cycle_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - Missing authority artifacts open a human/ssot-gen gate instead of being bypassed in RTL
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections

### RTL-0004: Gate: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
- Detail: Every SSOT workflow_todos.rtl-gen item must be executable by rtl-gen and therefore must carry content, detail, and criteria.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed.
- Criteria:
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has content
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has detail
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has at least one criteria entry
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract

### RTL-0005: Gate: every SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
- Detail: Function-level, cycle-level, register, dataflow, and FSM behavior must map to an RTL owner module before approval.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: Every required SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module.
- Criteria:
  - No required function_model task is orphaned
  - No required cycle_model task is orphaned
  - No required register/dataflow/FSM task is orphaned
  - Owner module and owner file are recorded in rtl_todo_plan.json
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability

### RTL-0016: Gate: SSOT connection contracts match RTL child port maps

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
- Detail: Named port maps prove that child instances are wired, but not that they are wired to the SSOT-intended signals. When the SSOT provides integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections, rtl-gen must satisfy those machine-readable connection contracts. Production-profile multi-module RTL must provide such contracts.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: SSOT connection contracts are satisfied by reachable RTL named port maps.
- Criteria:
  - Production-profile multi-module IPs provide machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections
  - Each SSOT connection contract resolves to a reachable manifest child module and port
  - RTL named port-map expressions match the SSOT-intended signal terms or carry an explicit SSOT waiver
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence

### RTL-0020: Gate: production RTL uses locked SSOT/FL/coverage authority artifacts

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.golden_authority_artifacts
- Detail: PL330-level RTL cannot proceed from prose alone. It must carry machine-readable authority artifacts that separate human-owned truth from LLM-editable implementation.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.golden_authority_artifacts.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: Production golden authority artifacts are locked, approved, current, and machine-readable.
- Criteria:
  - governance/authority.json exists
  - authority.json is the current IP human_llm_authority_manifest
  - authority operating rules R1..R6 and LLM loops L1..L9 are present
  - human authority gates G1..G7 are approved before production RTL-GEN
  - repo_layout separates locked SSOT/model/coverage truth from LLM-editable rtl/tb/sim/report work
  - model/functional_model.py exists
  - model/fl_model_check.json passed=true
  - model/model_signature.json matches the current SSOT-derived golden model signature
  - model/decomposition.json complete=true with unblocked implementation units
  - cov/fcov_plan.json has planned bins before RTL signoff
  - verify/equivalence_goals.json has required, unblocked goals
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.golden_authority_artifacts
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.golden_authority_artifacts

### RTL-0021: Gate: production RTL scale target is locked or explicitly waived

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale
- Detail: When a calibration reference profile provides target-scale candidates, a human must lock the chosen minimum structural scale in SSOT quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale or record an explicit SSOT target_scale_waiver before rtl-gen can claim production signoff.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: SSOT quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale contains human-locked structural scale minima.
- Criteria:
  - Reference-derived suggested_ssot_target_scale candidates are review inputs only
  - SSOT quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale contains human-locked structural depth minima before PL330-level PASS claims
  - If target scale is intentionally not enforced, SSOT contains target_scale_waiver.approved=true with a rationale
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.target_scale

### RTL-0023: Gate: production RTL has executable cycle/handshake model evidence

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.cycle_model_artifacts
- Detail: Complex DMA-class RTL needs a cycle-level oracle for latency, handshake, ordering, backpressure, and performance-sensitive behavior.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.cycle_model_artifacts.
Owner: mctp_assembler_v3 in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: Cycle model artifact and self-check are present.
- Criteria:
  - model/cycle_model.py exists
  - model/cl_model_check.json passed=true
  - cycle_model evidence traces to SSOT cycle_model
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.cycle_model_artifacts
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/mctp_assembler_v3.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.cycle_model_artifacts
