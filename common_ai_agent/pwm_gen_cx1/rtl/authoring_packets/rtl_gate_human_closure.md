# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_human_closure

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: pwm_gen_cx1
- Owner file: rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- Task count: 5
- Required tasks: 5

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Tasks tagged repair_generated_fm_marker are advisory schema-repair markers; they are omitted from authoring packets and must not cause fm*_observed RTL ports, wires, or state.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Tasks

### RTL-0003: Gate: SSOT function_model and cycle_model are present before RTL generation

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
- Detail: rtl-gen cannot implement production RTL until the SSOT contains both the functional golden behavior and the cycle/handshake contract.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections.
Owner: pwm_gen_cx1 in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv via single_owner.
- Current reason: SSOT function_model and cycle_model authority is present.
- Criteria:
  - function_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - cycle_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - Missing authority artifacts open a human/ssot-gen gate instead of being bypassed in RTL
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections

### RTL-0004: Gate: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
- Detail: Every SSOT workflow_todos.rtl-gen item must be executable by rtl-gen and therefore must carry content, detail, and criteria.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract.
Owner: pwm_gen_cx1 in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv via single_owner.
- Current reason: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed.
- Criteria:
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has content
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has detail
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has at least one criteria entry
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract

### RTL-0005: Gate: every SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
- Detail: Function-level, cycle-level, register, dataflow, and FSM behavior must map to an RTL owner module before approval.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability.
Owner: pwm_gen_cx1 in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv via single_owner.
- Current reason: Every required SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module.
- Criteria:
  - No required function_model task is orphaned
  - No required cycle_model task is orphaned
  - No required register/dataflow/FSM task is orphaned
  - Owner module and owner file are recorded in rtl_todo_plan.json
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability

### RTL-0008: Gate: locked behavioral/structural contracts are implemented in RTL

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.locked_truth_contract_implementation
- Detail: RTL generation must not rely only on SSOT projection traceability. When req/behavioral_contracts.json or req/structural_contracts.json is present, rtl-gen loads the locked contract source, derives contract-owned ledger rows, and requires live RTL evidence for every RTL-owned contract.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.locked_truth_contract_implementation.
Owner: pwm_gen_cx1 in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv via single_owner.
- Current reason: 5 locked-truth contract task(s) have RTL implementation evidence.
- Criteria:
  - Locked behavioral contracts with RTL ownership have contract.behavioral.rtl ledger rows
  - Each RTL-owned behavioral contract has an explicit rtl/rtl-gen stage_contract
  - Each behavioral contract row maps to at least one SSOT behavior projection ref
  - Structural contract signals are checked directly against the RTL top declaration
  - Contract evidence is live RTL source evidence, not comments, TB code, or trace-only metadata
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.locked_truth_contract_implementation
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.locked_truth_contract_implementation

### RTL-0017: Gate: SSOT connection contracts match RTL child port maps

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
- Detail: Named port maps prove that child instances are wired, but not that they are wired to the SSOT-intended signals. When the SSOT provides integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections, rtl-gen must satisfy those machine-readable connection contracts. Production-profile multi-module RTL must provide such contracts.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence.
Owner: pwm_gen_cx1 in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv via single_owner.
- Current reason: SSOT connection contracts are satisfied by reachable RTL named port maps.
- Criteria:
  - Production-profile multi-module IPs provide machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections
  - Each SSOT connection contract resolves to a reachable manifest child module and port
  - RTL named port-map expressions match the SSOT-intended signal terms or carry an explicit SSOT waiver
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pwm_gen_cx1.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
