# RTL Authoring Packet: module__fifo_sync__error_handling

- Kind: module
- Owner module: fifo_sync
- Owner file: rtl/fifo_sync.sv
- Task count: 2
- Required tasks: 2

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: production
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: True
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: True
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 2
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- Owner refs: top_module, io_list, parameters, interrupts, features, error_handling, security, debug_observability, integration, timing, power, synthesis, dft, test_requirements, quality_gates, workflow_todos
- Module slice: 4/9 section=error_handling task_limit=48
- Slice rule: Owner module fifo_sync is split into 9 authoring slices. Update the same owner_file incrementally and preserve logic from earlier slices.
- SSOT connection contracts:
  - fifo_sync_ptrs.clk_i <= PCLK (integration.connections[0])
  - fifo_sync_ptrs.rst_ni <= PRESETn (integration.connections[1])
  - fifo_sync_mem.clk_i <= PCLK (integration.connections[2])
  - fifo_sync_mem.wr_en_i <= push_accepted (integration.connections[3])
  - fifo_sync_mem.wr_addr_i <= wr_ptr (integration.connections[4])
  - fifo_sync_mem.wr_data_i <= wr_data_i (integration.connections[5])
  - fifo_sync_mem.rd_addr_i <= rd_ptr (integration.connections[6])
  - fifo_sync_mem.rd_data_o <= mem_rd_data (integration.connections[7])
  - fifo_sync_flags.count_i <= count (integration.connections[8])
  - fifo_sync_flags.full_o <= full_o (integration.connections[9])
  - fifo_sync_flags.empty_o <= empty_o (integration.connections[10])
  - fifo_sync_flags.almost_full_o <= almost_full_o (integration.connections[11])
- SSOT top IO contracts: 20

## Tasks

### RTL-0213: Implement error/fault item recovery_0

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: error_handling.recovery
- Source ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0
- Detail: This SSOT error_handling.recovery item must map to RTL behavior, integration evidence, or a precise blocker.
SSOT ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0.
Owner: fifo_sync in rtl/fifo_sync.sv via error_handling.
SSOT item context: action=none required for overflow/underflow.
- Current reason: Owner RTL file is missing: rtl/fifo_sync.sv.
- Criteria:
  - RTL owner/evidence is named for this SSOT item
  - Behavior is not represented only by comments or TB code
  - Downstream verification can observe or justify the item
  - Traceability keeps source_ref error_handling.recovery.recovery_0
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/fifo_sync.sv
- SSOT refs: error_handling.recovery.recovery_0

### RTL-0214: Implement error/fault item recovery_1

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: error_handling.recovery
- Source ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_1
- Detail: This SSOT error_handling.recovery item must map to RTL behavior, integration evidence, or a precise blocker.
SSOT ref: error_handling.recovery.recovery_1.
Owner: fifo_sync in rtl/fifo_sync.sv via error_handling.
SSOT item context: action=APB master must retry or handle pslverr.
- Current reason: Owner RTL file is missing: rtl/fifo_sync.sv.
- Criteria:
  - RTL owner/evidence is named for this SSOT item
  - Behavior is not represented only by comments or TB code
  - Downstream verification can observe or justify the item
  - Traceability keeps source_ref error_handling.recovery.recovery_1
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/fifo_sync.sv
- SSOT refs: error_handling.recovery.recovery_1
