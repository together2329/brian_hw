# RTL Authoring Packet: module__pulse_gen__rtl_flow

- Kind: module
- Owner module: pulse_gen
- Owner file: rtl/pulse_gen.sv
- Task count: 2
- Required tasks: 2

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: standard
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: True
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: True
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 0
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- Owner refs: top_module, io_list, parameters, interrupts, features, error_handling, security, debug_observability, integration, timing, power, synthesis, dft, test_requirements, quality_gates, workflow_todos
- Module slice: 1/9 section=rtl_flow task_limit=48
- Slice rule: Owner module pulse_gen is split into 9 authoring slices. Update the same owner_file incrementally and preserve logic from earlier slices.
- SSOT connection contracts:
  - pulse_gen_core.clk_i <= PCLK (integration.connections[0])
  - pulse_gen_core.rst_ni <= PRESETn (integration.connections[1])
  - pulse_gen_core.trigger_i <= trigger_i (integration.connections[2])
  - pulse_gen_core.pulse_out <= pulse_out (integration.connections[3])
  - pulse_gen_core.irq_o <= irq_o (integration.connections[4])
  - pulse_gen_regs.clk_i <= PCLK (integration.connections[5])
  - pulse_gen_regs.rst_ni <= PRESETn (integration.connections[6])
  - pulse_gen.PRDATA <= pulse_gen_regs.PRDATA (integration.connections[7])
  - pulse_gen.PREADY <= 1'b1 (zero-wait-state) (integration.connections[8])
  - pulse_gen.PSLVERR <= pulse_gen_regs.PSLVERR (integration.connections[9])
  - pulse_gen_regs.ctrl_fire_o <= pulse_gen_core.ctrl_fire (integration.connections[10])
  - pulse_gen_regs.ctrl_enable_o <= pulse_gen_core.ctrl_enable (integration.connections[11])
- SSOT top IO contracts: 14

## Tasks

### RTL-0001: Read SSOT and build dynamic RTL implementation ledger

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_flow.seed
- Source ref: top_module
- Detail: Use rtl_todo_plan.json derived from the current SSOT as the implementation checklist. Seed tasks are not the work breakdown; expand directly from the dynamic plan.
SSOT ref: top_module.
Owner: pulse_gen in rtl/pulse_gen.sv via top_module.
- Current reason: Task criteria are closed by SSOT traceability plus owner RTL/audit evidence.
- Criteria:
  - rtl_todo_plan.json was regenerated from the current SSOT
  - Every required task in the plan is either implemented, evidenced, or escalated
  - No IP-specific fixed template is used as the source of truth
  - Traceability keeps source_ref top_module
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pulse_gen.sv
- SSOT refs: top_module

### RTL-0002: Implement top-level ports, reset, and filelist integration

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_flow.top
- Source ref: io_list
- Detail: The top wrapper must expose the SSOT ports and connect every owned RTL file without hiding active behavior behind constants.
SSOT ref: io_list.
Owner: pulse_gen in rtl/pulse_gen.sv via top_module.
SSOT item context: value=pulse_gen.
- Current reason: Task criteria are closed by SSOT traceability plus owner RTL/audit evidence.
- Criteria:
  - Top module name matches SSOT top_module
  - Every SSOT top-level port appears with matching direction and width
  - Filelist contains all LLM-authored RTL sources and no stale sources
  - Traceability keeps source_ref io_list
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/pulse_gen.sv
- SSOT refs: io_list
