# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_tool_evidence

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: cortex_m0lite
- Owner file: rtl/cortex_m0lite.sv
- Task count: 7
- Required tasks: 7

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Tasks

### RTL-0006: Gate: RTL is authored by common_ai_agent rtl-gen, not by direct operator edits

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.dynamic_todo_closure
- Detail: rtl-gen PASS is forbidden until all required implementation, SSOT workflow, and RTL gate TODOs have pass status.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.dynamic_todo_closure.
Owner: cortex_m0lite in rtl/cortex_m0lite.sv via top_fallback.
- Current reason: 29 required non-closure TODO(s) remain open.

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.protocol_assertion_evidence
- Detail: PL330-level RTL needs protocol-checker style evidence for interface, ordering, valid/ready, reset, and backpressure rules. The assertion source comes from SSOT cycle_model; the pass condition comes from real simulation evidence.

- Required: True
- Status: open

SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.fl_rtl_goal_audit.
Owner: cortex_m0lite in rtl/cortex_m0lite.sv via top_fallback.

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen

  - coverage status is pass
  - functional coverage pct meets target
  - coverage.json source is ssot_coverage_summary
  - functional hit equals total with pct >= 100 for planned bins
  - rtl_observed.status is pass with passing scoreboard events and coverage refs

  - coverage limitations are empty or explicitly waived in SSOT
