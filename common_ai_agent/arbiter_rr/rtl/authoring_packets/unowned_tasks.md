# RTL Authoring Packet: unowned_tasks

- Kind: unowned
- Owner module: <none>
- Owner file: <none>
- Task count: 1
- Required tasks: 1

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: production
- Work allowed: False
- Draft allowed: False
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: True
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 1
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- SSOT target scale: min_behavior_owner_logic_modules=1, min_logic_modules=1, min_modules=3, min_procedural_blocks=4, min_source_files=3, min_state_updates=3
- SSOT connection contracts:
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PCLK <= PCLK (integration.connections[0])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PRESETn <= PRESETn (integration.connections[1])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PADDR <= PADDR (integration.connections[2])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PSEL <= PSEL (integration.connections[3])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PENABLE <= PENABLE (integration.connections[4])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PWRITE <= PWRITE (integration.connections[5])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PWDATA <= PWDATA (integration.connections[6])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PRDATA <= PRDATA (integration.connections[7])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PREADY <= PREADY (integration.connections[8])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PSLVERR <= PSLVERR (integration.connections[9])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.enable_o <= arb_enable (integration.connections[10])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.mask_o <= req_mask (integration.connections[11])

## Tasks

### RTL-0120: Implement dataflow sequence: sequence_0

- Priority: high
- Required: True
- Status: open
- Category: dataflow.sequence
- Source ref: dataflow.sequence.sequence_0
- Detail: Dataflow steps must be reflected in real datapath/control/storage logic.
SSOT ref: dataflow.sequence.sequence_0.
SSOT item context: value=req_i → mask → priority_rotate → encode → register → gnt_o / gnt_idx_o / gnt_valid_o.
- Current reason: Task has no RTL owner file.
- Criteria:
  - RTL data/control path implements the described step
  - Ordering/backpressure is consistent with cycle_model
  - Downstream checks can observe the result or side effect
  - Traceability keeps source_ref dataflow.sequence.sequence_0
- SSOT refs: dataflow.sequence.sequence_0
