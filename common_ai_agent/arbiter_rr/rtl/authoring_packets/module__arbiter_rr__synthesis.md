# RTL Authoring Packet: module__arbiter_rr__synthesis

- Kind: module
- Owner module: arbiter_rr
- Owner file: rtl/arbiter_rr.sv
- Task count: 6
- Required tasks: 6

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Context

- Quality profile: production
- Work allowed: True
- Draft allowed: True
- Evidence closure allowed: False
- PASS allowed: False
- Integration signoff allowed: True
- LLM-actionable open tasks: 0
- Human-locked open tasks: 0
- Owner refs: top_module, io_list, parameters, interrupts, features, error_handling, security, debug_observability, integration, timing, power, synthesis, dft, test_requirements, quality_gates, workflow_todos
- Module slice: 6/9 section=synthesis task_limit=48
- Slice rule: Owner module arbiter_rr is split into 9 authoring slices. Update the same owner_file incrementally and preserve logic from earlier slices.
- SSOT target scale: min_behavior_owner_logic_modules=1, min_logic_modules=1, min_modules=3, min_procedural_blocks=4, min_source_files=3, min_state_updates=3
- SSOT connection contracts:
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PCLK <= PCLK (integration.connections[0])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PRESETn <= PRESETn (integration.connections[1])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PADDR <= PADDR (integration.connections[2])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PSEL <= PSEL (integration.connections[3])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PENABLE <= PENABLE (integration.connections[4])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PWRITE <= PWRITE (integration.connections[5])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PWDATA <= PWDATA (integration.connections[6])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PRDATA <= PRDATA (integration.connections[7])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PREADY <= PREADY (integration.connections[8])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.PSLVERR <= PSLVERR (integration.connections[9])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.enable_o <= arb_enable (integration.connections[10])
  - arbiter_rr_regs.mask_o <= req_mask (integration.connections[11])
- SSOT top IO contracts: 14
