# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_tool_evidence

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: arbiter_rr
- Owner file: rtl/arbiter_rr.sv
- Task count: 7
- Required tasks: 7

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.protocol_assertion_evidence
- Detail: PL330-level RTL needs protocol-checker style evidence for interface, ordering, valid/ready, reset, and backpressure rules. The assertion source comes from SSOT cycle_model; the pass condition comes from real simulation evidence.

SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.fl_rtl_goal_audit.
Owner: arbiter_rr in rtl/arbiter_rr.sv via top_module.

  - coverage limitations are empty or explicitly waived in SSOT
