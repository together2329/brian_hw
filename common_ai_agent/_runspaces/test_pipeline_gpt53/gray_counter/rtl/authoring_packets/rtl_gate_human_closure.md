# RTL Authoring Packet: rtl_gate_human_closure

- Kind: gate
- Owner module: gray_counter
- Owner file: rtl/gray_counter.sv
- Task count: 4
- Required tasks: 4

## Rules

- No fixed RTL template: author real IP-specific RTL from SSOT-derived tasks.
- Do not edit locked SSOT/FL/coverage/interface/performance authority artifacts.
- Every task must satisfy content, detail, and criteria before the packet is closed.
- For split owner modules, preserve existing owner_file logic from earlier slices and add only the missing behavior for this slice.
- Static RTL evidence is matched after SystemVerilog comments are stripped: required evidence_terms must appear as live RTL identifiers, declarations, or expressions in the owner_file, and the resulting RTL must remain lint-clean.
- Do not add evidence-only alias wires or identifiers copied from natural-language criteria; evidence must come from real control, datapath, CSR, FSM, CDC, or IO behavior.
- Record generated RTL files and todo_plan_sha256 in rtl_authoring_provenance.json.

## Tasks

### RTL-0003: Gate: SSOT function_model and cycle_model are present before RTL generation

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
- Detail: rtl-gen cannot implement production RTL until the SSOT contains both the functional golden behavior and the cycle/handshake contract.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections.
Owner: gray_counter_top in rtl/gray_counter.sv via semantic_terms:top.
- Current reason: SSOT function_model and cycle_model authority is present.
- Criteria:
  - function_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - cycle_model is present and non-empty in the SSOT
  - Missing authority artifacts open a human/ssot-gen gate instead of being bypassed in RTL
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/gray_counter.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.ssot_required_sections

### RTL-0004: Gate: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
- Detail: Every SSOT workflow_todos.rtl-gen item must be executable by rtl-gen and therefore must carry content, detail, and criteria.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract.
Owner: gray_counter_top in rtl/gray_counter.sv via semantic_terms:top.
- Current reason: SSOT-authored rtl-gen workflow TODOs are well formed.
- Criteria:
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has content
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has detail
  - Every workflow_todos.rtl-gen item has at least one criteria entry
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/gray_counter.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.workflow_todo_contract

### RTL-0005: Gate: every SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
- Detail: Function-level, cycle-level, register, dataflow, and FSM behavior must map to an RTL owner module before approval.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability.
Owner: gray_counter_top in rtl/gray_counter.sv via semantic_terms:top.
- Current reason: Every required SSOT-derived RTL behavior has an owner module.
- Criteria:
  - No required function_model task is orphaned
  - No required cycle_model task is orphaned
  - No required register/dataflow/FSM task is orphaned
  - Owner module and owner file are recorded in rtl_todo_plan.json
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/gray_counter.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.owner_traceability

### RTL-0016: Gate: SSOT connection contracts match RTL child port maps

- Priority: critical
- Required: True
- Status: pass
- Category: rtl_gate.rtl_gen
- Source ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
- Detail: Named port maps prove that child instances are wired, but not that they are wired to the SSOT-intended signals. When the SSOT provides integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections, rtl-gen must satisfy those machine-readable connection contracts. Production-profile multi-module RTL must provide such contracts.
SSOT ref: quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence.
Owner: gray_counter_top in rtl/gray_counter.sv via semantic_terms:top.
- Current reason: SSOT connection contracts are satisfied by reachable RTL named port maps.
- Criteria:
  - Production-profile multi-module IPs provide machine-readable integration.connections or sub_modules[].connections
  - Each SSOT connection contract resolves to a reachable manifest child module and port
  - RTL named port-map expressions match the SSOT-intended signal terms or carry an explicit SSOT waiver
  - Traceability keeps source_ref quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
  - Primary implementation evidence is in rtl/gray_counter.sv
- SSOT refs: quality_gates, quality_gates.rtl_gen.manifest_connection_contract_evidence
