# ATLAS Pipeline Screen

`◫ Pipeline` is a top-level ATLAS screen that turns the 14-stage
common_ai_agent flow into a click-to-run + glance-to-read situation
board. It replaced the mock `◫ Architect` screen on 2026-05-16 (see
[[log]] entry).

## Why it exists

Before Pipeline, every stage of the flow was dispatched by typing
slash commands into the Workspace chat box (`/to-ssot`,
`/ssot-fl-model arm_m0_min`, `/ssot-rtl arm_m0_min`,
`/ssot-tb arm_m0_min`, `/sim arm_m0_min`, `/lint arm_m0_min`, … ×
14). The user had to remember the slash name, the IP, the workflow,
and the mode every time. There was no at-a-glance status surface for
the whole IP.

Pipeline gives:

- **One-click dispatch** per stage (or a chain of stages).
- **Large live DAG map** showing the pipeline as the primary workspace,
  with swimlanes, selected-path highlighting, numbered handoff steps, and
  token-flow animation along active edges.
- **Per-stage scoresheet** — 3-5 KPI dots read directly from each
  stage's evidence JSON. Pass / warn / fail / idle at a glance.
- **Owner-aware failure routing** — failed cards offer
  `[ go fix <owner> ]` (never `[ retry ]`), per
  [[workflow-ownership-and-boundaries]].
- **Mode toggle** without typing — `● pipeline / ○ interactive` chip
  in the run-bar.

## Where it lives

| Layer | Location |
|---|---|
| Top-bar button | `frontend/atlas/app.jsx` `◫ Pipeline` |
| Top-level mount | `frontend/atlas/app.jsx` `<window.AtlasPipeline />` |
| Component file | `frontend/atlas/pipeline.jsx` |
| CSS | `frontend/atlas/styles.css` `/* ── Pipeline screen ── */` block |
| Backend state endpoint | `GET /api/pipeline/state?ip=<ip>` in `src/atlas_api_jobs.py` |
| Backend dispatch | `POST /api/pipeline/dispatch` (`src/atlas_api_jobs.py`) |
| Per-stage KPI compute | `compute_kpi_dots(ip, stage)` in `src/workflow_stage_surface.py` |

## Visual Target

The Pipeline screen should feel like the reference flow-map screenshots the user
provided (`/Users/brian/Downloads/IMG_1345.JPG`,
`IMG_1344.jpg`, `IMG_1342.jpg`, `IMG_1341.jpg`,
`IMG_1336.PNG`, `IMG_1343.jpg`): a dark, spacious architecture map with
highlighted paths, stage status always visible on the left, and orchestrator
chat always visible on the right.

This is the important product direction:

```text
wrong: small pipeline widget + many tiny status cards
right: left stage rail + large center flow map + right orchestrator chat
wrong: putting flow controls under the graph
right: putting flow and step controls above the graph
```

The user reaction to the current card-heavy version was that Pipeline is "too
small and looks rough." Treat that as a product requirement, not polish feedback.
The main surface must be a large graph/canvas where the IP development pipeline
is visible as a system.

Design cues from the references:

- Dark canvas, not a white dashboard.
- Wide swimlanes with vertical section bands.
- Most inactive nodes are muted but still visible for context.
- Selected path is bright amber/yellow with thicker node borders and connected
  curved lines.
- Edge hops have small numbered badges so the user can follow execution order.
- Center header contains two compact horizontal rows:
  - **Flows**: selectable scenario/run definitions.
  - **Steps**: numbered execution/handoff steps for the selected flow.
- The graph is the primary object; the left rail shows stage status and the
  right rail is reserved for orchestrator chat.
- Text is compact but readable; avoid tiny labels and low-contrast gray.

ATLAS-specific visual mapping:

| Reference concept | ATLAS Pipeline concept |
|---|---|
| Architecture/service boxes | Workflow stages and worker endpoints |
| Yellow selected route | Selected pipeline, repair loop, or signoff path |
| Numbered edge dots | Stage order, handoff order, or rerun order |
| Flow control row | Full pipeline, RTL repair loop, TB/sim loop, PPA signoff, coverage closure |
| Step control row | Concrete stage actions with evidence files and owner workflow |
| Muted unavailable boxes | Locked/stale/offline stages |

The graph should support these first-class selectable flows:

- **Full IP pipeline**: `ssot -> fl/cl -> rtl -> lint/tb/sim -> coverage -> signoff`
- **RTL repair loop**: `sim-debug -> rtl-gen -> lint -> tb-gen -> sim -> coverage -> sim-debug`
- **TB/sim repair loop**: `sim-debug -> tb-gen -> sim -> coverage -> sim-debug`
- **Coverage closure**: `coverage -> coverage repair -> tb-gen/sim -> coverage`
- **PPA signoff**: `rtl -> syn -> sta -> pnr -> sta-post`
- **JSON handoff / take**: `orchestrator -> pending handoff -> workspace take -> owner workflow`

## Layout

Target layout is graph-first, not card-first.

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| Left | IP selector plus every stage's current status, evidence summary, and state |
| Center | Full-height DAG/flow canvas with swimlanes and selected route highlighting |
| Right | Orchestrator chat for pipeline-level instructions and user input |

Sizing rules:

- Desktop uses a three-column grid: about 300 px left rail, fluid center graph,
  and about 430 px right orchestrator chat.
- Graph height should be at least 65vh and should not collapse into a strip.
- Flow selection and numbered step controls stay above the graph, never below it.
- Right chat should be wide enough for readable command/history text and scroll independently.
- Stage cards are not the main layout. They can appear as compact node popovers
  or detail drilldowns, not as the default screen.
- The old 2-column stage-card grid is acceptable only as a secondary/detail
  view, not the default Pipeline experience.

## User-first Green Readiness

The Pipeline screen must be usable without knowing internal gate names such as
`goal_audit`, `derive_rtl_todos`, or `coverage blocked`.

The left rail therefore starts with a **Green Readiness** card above the expert
stage list. Backend source is `GET /api/progress`, field
`selected.simple_summary` (also mirrored at `selected.signoff.simple_summary`).
That summary is deliberately user-facing:

- `headline` and `message` explain the current state in plain language.
- `percent` gives a rough "how close to green" readout.
- `primary_action` is a simple action such as `Run to Green` or `Open Review`.
- `next_steps[]` is capped to the first few useful actions and labels ownership
  as `user` or `atlas`.
- Raw internal blockers remain available under `expert_blockers`, but they are
  not the first thing a normal user sees.

Example policy: a real requirements blocker should render as "One user review
is needed" / "Complete requirements review", not as
`goal audit fail blockers=req`. The expert string still stays in the payload so
debuggers and tests can inspect the exact gate.

## Current Validation

2026-05-16 validation evidence:

- Browser smoke on `127.0.0.1:5410` verified the new Green Readiness card is
  visible above the left stage rail, the right orchestrator chat remains mounted,
  and there is no JSX/runtime crash. Screenshot:
  `/tmp/atlas_pipeline_green_v2.png`.
- Browser layout smoke on `127.0.0.1:8766` showed a 3-column board:
  left stage rail at `x=0`, center flow map at `x=300`, right orchestrator
  chat at `x=1491`, and `pipe-flow-inspector` count `0`.
- `tests/test_pipeline_orchestrator_worker_integration.py` starts two
  mock HTTP workers and verifies the default 15-stage full-IP pipeline
  can complete through `/api/pipeline/dispatch` with `schedule=auto`.
  It also verifies the focused `rtl-gen -> {lint,tb-gen,syn}` fanout
  path across a second worker after `/status` + `/result` reports RTL
  completion.
- The same test file also starts real `core.agent_server.create_app()`
  worker endpoints with the LLM loop patched out, proving the Pipeline
  dispatcher can talk to the same `/run`, `/status`, and `/result`
  surface used by `python3 src/main.py --serve`.
- The same integration test verifies `ATLAS_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=1`
  surfaces a pending JSON handoff in `/api/pipeline/state` and that
  downstream worker payloads carry `rtl_version_id` plus artifact context.

Phase bands group the 14 stages by domain semantics, not by status:

- **AUTHOR** — `ssot`
- **DETERMINISTIC** — `fl-model`, `cl-model`, `equiv` (visually muted; 0 LLM calls per [[deterministic-emit-stages]])
- **IMPLEMENT** — `rtl`, `lint`, `tb` (the long expensive LLM stages — biggest cards)
- **VERIFY** — `sim`, `coverage`, `sim-debug`, `goal-audit` (truth-check + blame routing)
- **SIGN-OFF** — `syn`, `sta`, `pnr`, `sta-post` (collapsed by default; rarely run for educational IPs)

Recommended swimlanes for the graph:

- REQUIREMENTS / SSOT
- MODELS / COVERAGE PLAN
- RTL / TB AUTHORING
- VERIFY / DEBUG
- EDA SIGNOFF
- ORCHESTRATOR / WORKERS / HANDOFFS

## State derivation (DB-first, FS-fallback)

Per-stage `state` (idle / running / passed / failed / blocked / stale /
locked) is computed from these signals, in priority order:

1. **In-flight job** (`/api/jobs` snapshot) → `running`.
2. **`workflow_runs` row** for `(workspace_id, ip_id, workflow_name)`,
   most recent → `running` / `passed` (`status=completed`) /
   `failed` (`status in {error, blocked, cancelled}`). DB is the
   source of truth here, surviving filesystem moves and
   `ATLAS_PROJECT_ROOT` changes.
3. **Filesystem evidence** (`_job_artifact_recovery`) → `passed`.
   Used only when no DB row exists, covering hand-placed artifacts
   (e.g., `cp -R old_run/<ip>/ .`).
4. **Dependency check** (`_PIPELINE_STAGE_DEPS`) → `ready` if all
   upstream stages are `passed`, else `locked`. Locked cards
   carry a `locked_reason` like `"needs ssot"` so the UI can render
   `(needs ssot)` instead of just `LOCKED`.
5. **`<ip>/rtl/rtl_blocked.json`** non-empty → `blocked`.

The response includes a `source` field on each stage:
`"db"` / `"fs"` / `"none"`, so callers know where the verdict came
from. KPI numerics (the 3-5 dot scoresheet — compile_rc, lint_errors,
sim_mismatches, etc.) are still read from on-disk JSON because the DB
schema does not yet store them; see [[atlas-pipeline-db-state]] for
the migration plan.

## Live data contract

`GET /api/pipeline/state?ip=<ip>` returns:

```json
{
  "ip": "arm_m0_min",
  "rtl_version_id": "rtl-v007",
  "mode": "pipeline",
  "stages": {
    "ssot": {
      "state": "passed",
      "glyph": "✓",
      "scoresheet": ["pass","pass","pass","pass","pass"],
      "iter": null, "progress": null, "live_tail": null,
      "top": "yaml/arm_m0_min.ssot.yaml · 72 KB · 34 sect",
      "secondary": "0 TBD · 62 iters · 12m",
      "evidence_paths": ["yaml/arm_m0_min.ssot.yaml"],
      "abortable": false,
      "model": "gpt-5.3-codex", "effort": "high",
      "history": [{"run_id":"…","state":"passed","duration_s":712,"model":"…","cost":0.42}],
      "blame": null
    },
    "rtl": {"state":"running","iter":"12/19","progress":0.65, "…": "…"},
    "…": "…"
  }
}
```

8-state model:

| State | Source |
|---|---|
| `idle` | no `workflow_runs` row AND no on-disk artifact |
| `ready` | upstream all fresh; no running job |
| `running` | `/api/jobs` row with `status=running` |
| `passed` | latest job completed AND artifacts present AND fresh |
| `failed` | latest job error/blocked OR validator JSON shows failure |
| `blocked-by-human-gate` | `<ip>/rtl/rtl_blocked.json` non-empty OR sim_human_gate_doc |
| `evidence-stale` | upstream `rtl_version_id` newer than this stage's |
| `locked` | direct upstream is `idle` or `failed` (per `_PIPELINE_STAGE_DEPS`) |

## Running-state visual cues

A running stage is obvious from any glance angle:

1. **DAG MAP node pulse ring** — `box-shadow` ping expanding outward over 1.4 s.
2. **DAG MAP edge token-flow** — SVG `<animateMotion>` 4 px circle traveling along outgoing edges (1.6 s).
3. **StageCard top-stripe breath** — 1 px top border breathing cyan-strong ↔ cyan-mute over 2 s.
4. **Progress-bar shimmer** — linear-gradient highlight traveling left → right (1.2 s).
5. **Top-bar `▶ N running` chip** — same pulse animation; visible from every screen; click → jumps to the IP.
6. **Browser-tab title** — `▶ ATLAS — <ip> (<stage>)` while any stage runs.

All wrapped in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { animation: none !important; … } .pipe-node[data-state="running"] { outline: 2px solid var(--cyan); }`.

## Per-stage KPI scoresheet (3-5 dots)

| Stage | Dots → source JSON |
|---|---|
| ssot-gen | section_count · qa_resolved · tbd=0 · isa_spec · register_file (`yaml/<ip>.ssot.yaml`) |
| fl-model-gen | emit_passed · self_check.passed · fcov_plan · manifest_ok (`model/fl_model_check.json`, `cov/fcov_plan.json`) |
| cl-model-gen | emit_passed · cl_self_check · cycle_cov_plan (`model/cl_model_check.json`) |
| equiv-goals | parses · goals_resolved · sub_module_refs (`verify/equivalence_goals.json`) |
| rtl-gen | compile_rc=0 · lint_clean · todo_audit=pass · provenance_present (`rtl/rtl_compile.json`, `lint/dut_lint.json`, `rtl/rtl_todo_plan.json`, `rtl/rtl_authoring_provenance.json`) |
| lint | errors=0 · warnings≤waivers · waiver_count (`lint/dut_lint.json`) |
| tb-gen | top_present · scoreboard · tc_count · manifest (`tb/cocotb/*`) |
| sim | results.xml=pass · mismatches=0 · vcd_present · seed_coverage (`sim/results.xml`, `sim/fl_rtl_compare.json`) |
| coverage | bins_hit/total · cycle_cov · func_cov · uncov_count (`cov/coverage.json`) |
| sim-debug | classification_present · owner_routed · feedback_packet (`sim/mismatch_classification.json`) |
| goal-audit | failed_checks=0 · blockers=0 · status=pass (`sim/fl_rtl_goal_audit.json`) |
| syn / sta / pnr / sta-post | tool_rc · area · timing_slack · fanout · power (per-stage report JSON) |

Click a dot → opens the source JSON in the existing `FileViewer` overlay.

## Interactions

| # | Action | Wiring |
|---|---|---|
| a | One-shot run | click card body or `[▶ run]` button → `POST /api/pipeline/dispatch` `{ip,stages:[id],schedule:'serial'}` |
| b | Chained run | Cmd/Ctrl-click stacks cards into DispatchRail; rail sends one call with `stages:[…]` |
| c | Re-run other model | right-click passed card → popover `[model ▾][effort ◐]`; submit dispatches single stage with new model |
| d | Inspect evidence | scoresheet dots and KPI rows visible on the card; click any dot → opens source JSON in `FileViewer` |
| e | Follow blame | failed card shows `! sim blame→rtl-gen`; `[ go fix rtl-gen ]` dispatches rtl-gen with the feedback packet path templated into prompt (per [[workflow-feedback-and-scheduling]]) |
| f | Abort running | running card shows `⏹` (Esc keybind) → `POST /api/job/{id}/cancel` |
| g | Switch mode | run-bar mode chip toggle sends `/mode pipeline` or `/mode normal` through chat input; warn-color when `interactive` |
| h | Inspect worker workspace | click `ssot-gen`, `rtl-gen`, or `tb-gen` in the worker orchestra row → opens `⌂ Workspace` for `.session/<session>/<ip>/<workflow>` and previews the representative artifact; see [[atlas-pipeline-worker-workspace-jump]] |

## Worker Workspace Drilldown

Pipeline is Orchestrator-first, but worker work must still be auditable. The
worker orchestra row therefore treats `ssot-gen`, `rtl-gen`, and `tb-gen` as
workspace drilldown buttons:

```text
ssot-gen -> <ip>/yaml/<ip>.ssot.yaml
rtl-gen  -> <ip>/rtl/rtl_authoring_status.md
tb-gen   -> <ip>/tb/cocotb/test_<ip>.py
```

The click switches the active namespace to
`.session/<session_id>/<ip>/<workflow>`, opens the Workspace screen, and opens
that representative file. Other worker buttons keep their existing
target-selection behavior unless they are explicitly promoted into this
workspace-drilldown set. Implementation and verification details live in
[[atlas-pipeline-worker-workspace-jump]].

## Anti-patterns deliberately avoided

| What we avoided | Why |
|---|---|
| Gantt / timeline view | Stage durations span 100× (cl-model 5 s vs rtl-gen 40 min); bars either lie or are invisible |
| Kanban (idle / ready / running / passed columns) | Destroys DAG ordering — the most valuable structural information |
| `[ retry ]` button on failed cards | Per [[workflow-ownership-and-boundaries]] §37-43 the canonical anti-pattern; `[ go fix <owner> ]` only |

## Backend evidence map (load-bearing file:line refs)

- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:39-55` — `_PIPELINE_STAGES` (15 canonical IDs).
- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:62-77` — `_PIPELINE_STAGE_DEPS` (DAG edges).
- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:78-81` — `_RTL_VERSION_DOWNSTREAM_STAGES` (stale rules).
- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:796-892` — `_job_artifact_recovery` (offline ground truth).
- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:1146-1211` — `POST /api/pipeline/dispatch` (existing).
- `src/atlas_api_jobs.py:1369-1389` — `POST /api/job/{id}/cancel`.
- `src/workflow_stage_engine.py:1654, 1675, 1687` — `mismatch_classification.json` (blame).
- `src/workflow_stage_surface.py` — `_rtl_authoring_summary`, new `compute_kpi_dots`.

## Frontend evidence map

- `frontend/atlas/app.tsx` — top-bar `◫ Pipeline` button + screen mount.
- `frontend/atlas/pipeline.tsx` — `AtlasPipeline / DagMap / StageCard / MiniScoresheet / DispatchRail`.
- `frontend/atlas/soc-architect.tsx` — `PIPELINE_STAGES`, `PIPELINE_LABEL`, `fullPipeline`, `PipelineStrip` (re-exported, still in use).
- `frontend/atlas/soc-architect.tsx` — `ArchitectChat` (re-mounted as Pipeline's right column).
- `frontend/atlas/data.tsx` — `DEFAULT_FLOW_STAGES` (glyph + colour tokens).
- `frontend/atlas/styles.css` — semantic colour tokens.
- Bundled by Vite (`frontend/atlas/index.vite.html` shell); the old `index.html` + per-file `pipeline.jsx` script tag are gone as of the 2026-05-30 .jsx retirement.

## Verification

End-to-end smoke after rollout:

1. **Endpoint shape**:
   `curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/pipeline/state?ip=arm_m0_min' | jq '.stages | keys'` → 15 canonical stage IDs.
2. **Screen swap**: open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, click `◫ Pipeline`, confirm `localStorage.atlasScreen === 'pipeline'`. Refresh → sticky.
3. **Live state**: dispatch rtl-gen via the RT card `[▶ run]` button; card transitions `idle → running → passed`; chat shows one `dispatched rtl-gen via PIPELINE` line.
4. **Locked semantics**: delete `<ip>/yaml/<ip>.ssot.yaml`; downstream cards dim, DAG nodes dim.
5. **Reduced motion**: enable OS "reduce motion" → animations replaced by `outline` only.

## Pipeline Image redesign (2026-05-18, phase 1)

Source of truth: `artifacts/runtime/ATLAS_UI_ENHANCEMENT/Pipeline Image.html` (self-contained mockup, ~45 KB).

Design language: cyan (`#5fc8eb`) = running, amber (`#f2b632`) = selected route / orchestrator state, green (`#76c893`) = passed, red (`#e85d5d`) = failed. Matches the mockup's `:root` tokens.

Token strategy: existing `--accent`, `--cyan`, `--ok`, `--err` vary by theme; phase-1 adds `--enh-*` aliases (16 new tokens in `frontend/atlas/styles.css` lines 53–74) so the new design language can land without touching theme-dependent existing values. Google Fonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono) added to `frontend/atlas/index.html` for typography consistency; cache-buster bumped to `atlas-20260518-redesign-phase1`.

What landed in phase 1:

- Design tokens (`--enh-*`) + Google Fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) in `frontend/atlas/styles.css` (lines 53–74) and `frontend/atlas/index.html`.
- `PhaseStrip` top-of-pipeline summary component (6 phases × phase-passed/running/blocked states, animated pulse on running) in `frontend/atlas/pipeline.jsx` lines 481–542, mounted at line 2633 before `PipelineFlowMap`.
- `WorkerOrchestraBar` re-skinned to 6-column `.worker-card` grid with `data-flow="dispatch|return|down|idle"` in `frontend/atlas/pipeline.jsx` lines 544–693; existing `pipe-orchestra-*` classes preserved on the same DOM nodes for backwards-compat.
- `axi_dma` mock IP (rtl-gen + sim simultaneously running) via fetch interceptor in `frontend/atlas/data.jsx` lines 21–101.

Deferred to phase 2 (own session):

- Full SVG flow canvas redesign — orchestrator bus bar, lane-by-lane dispatch/return arrows, animated packets.
- Footer detail cards with progress bars (`.pipe-cards` / `.pipe-card-tail` / `.pipe-progress-fill`).
- Title bar / flow tabs polish.

How to test visually: open `frontend/atlas/index.html`, pick IP `axi_dma`, observe phase strip showing RTL phase as `running` (cyan pulse) and Worker Orchestra Bar showing rtl-gen and sim cards both with `data-flow="dispatch"` (cyan animated arrow). The DAG flow map below is unchanged — that is phase 2.
