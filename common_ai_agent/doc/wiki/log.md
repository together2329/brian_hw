# Wiki Log

## 2026-05-15

- Created the tracked project wiki map for common_ai_agent under `doc/wiki/`.
- Added cross-linked pages for flow, ownership, todo evidence, provider call accounting, and human escalation.
- Captured the no-direct-generated-artifact-edit rule for pipeline tests.
- Pipeline smoke test (`gray_counter`, gpt-5.3-codex) under `_runspaces/test_pipeline_gpt53/`:
  - PASS: ssot-gen, fl-model-gen (after helper fix), cl-model-gen, dual-fcov, equiv-goals.
  - FAIL: rtl-gen audit. compile/lint clean, but `GC_TXN_ADVANCE.outputs.output_0` missed `bin`/`bin_state` static evidence (RTL-0062). owner = `rtl-gen` repair, no manual patch.
- Workflow source fix in `workflow/fl-model-gen/scripts/emit_fl_model.py`: registered canonical bit helpers (`gray_to_bin`, `bin_to_gray`, `popcount`, `parity`, `clog2`, `min`, `max`, `abs`) in the rule env and in `known_names`, so SSOT expressions may reference them without `run_self_check` shadowing the callable with a stub integer.
